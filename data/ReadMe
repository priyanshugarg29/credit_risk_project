Credit Risk Policy Assistant using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
This project demonstrates a practical implementation of a domain-specific RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system designed to assist credit analysts, risk officers, and loan underwriters in interpreting internal lending policies for various financial products.

Problem Statement
Credit underwriting processes in banks and financial institutions rely on complex, document-based policies that are often difficult to query or interpret consistently. Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with such proprietary knowledge that isn't part of their training data, leading to hallucinations or incomplete answers.

This project showcases how Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can be used to:

Retrieve relevant internal policy information in real-time
Provide grounded, explainable responses to credit-related queries
Support cross-sector credit risk management (e.g., personal loans, auto finance, SME lending)
Project Highlights
Domain: Credit Risk and Regulatory Lending Policies
Tech Stack: LangChain 路 FAISS 路 SentenceTransformers 路 OpenAI API 路 Python
Use Cases:
Eligibility checks
Affordability assessment (CONC 5.2A compliance)
Escalation routing based on approval matrices
Risk flag detection
Data privacy awareness (UK GDPR-style logic)
Dataset
The dataset consists of synthetic credit policy documents inspired by:

UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) CONC regulations
GDPR principles for customer data handling
Standard operating procedures across UK lending institutions

Components
Document Chunking & Embedding: Semantic text splitting + vector indexing with FAISS
Query Handling: LangChain-based retrieval pipeline with dynamic prompting
Evaluation: Qualitative comparison of LLM vs RAG performance on complex, policy-grounded queries
Potential Applications
Retail banking loan assistant
SME risk review system
Auto finance eligibility chatbot
Internal audit traceability tools
Future Work
Incorporate real-time transaction feeds via Open Banking
Extend to insurance and leasing policies
Add a Streamlit front-end for deployment
